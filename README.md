# 📘 SeabornQuest: Parameter-Driven Visualization Challenges

**SeabornQuest** is a curated question bank focused on mastering Seaborn’s core plotting functions through hands-on exploration of parameters like `hue`, `jitter`, `dodge`, `palette`, `bins`, `estimator`, and `multiple`. It’s designed for learners, analysts, and strategists who want to build intuition around visual storytelling in Python.

## 🔍 What’s Inside

This repository contains a structured set of questions and answers covering:

- `scatterplot`
- `histplot`
- `barplot`
- `kdeplot`
- `swarmplot`
- `stripplot`
- `pairplot`

Each question is crafted to explore how different parameters affect plot behavior, aesthetics, and interpretability — especially in multi-category datasets.

## 🧪 Parameters Explored

| Parameter     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `hue`         | Adds a categorical color dimension                                          |
| `jitter`      | Adds noise to prevent overlap in categorical scatterplots                   |
| `dodge`       | Separates overlapping elements by hue                                       |
| `palette`     | Controls color aesthetics across plots                                      |
| `bins`        | Defines histogram granularity                                               |
| `estimator`   | Aggregates data (e.g., `np.mean`, `np.median`)                              |
| `multiple`    | Controls stacking or overlay behavior in hist/kde plots                     |
